# Problem Statement
AI struggles to match human skill in diverse Pokémon battles, limiting challenging gaming experiences.

# Inadequacy of current solutions
Existing AI systems for Pokémon battles lack adaptability and struggle to emulate human-level strategies, resulting in predictable and less engaging gameplay experiences.

# Technical background applicable to the problem

# Approach to Problem
To improve AI performance in Pokémon battles, our team will implement Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) training using Pokémon Showdown battle data. We'll supplement this with self-play and engagements with other players. Testing involves scenarios with clear optimal choices and historical battle data simulations. Our approach will expose the AI to diverse team compositions and battle scenarios to enhance its adaptability across different strategies.
