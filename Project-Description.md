# Problem Statement

# Project Abstract
Our senior design project aims to develop an AI agent capable of playing as a Pokémon trainer using the popular online battle simulator, Pokémon Showdown’s public API. This project leverages the power of reinforcement learning techniques to create a proficient virtual trainer capable of making strategic decisions in a dynamic and competitive environment.

Pokémon Showdown is an online platform that provides a battle simulator for Pokémon games, enabling players to assemble and battle teams of Pokémon in real-time. Our project focuses on enhancing the game-playing experience by implementing a reinforcement learning algorithm to train the AI agent to make strategic decisions, such as selecting moves, switching Pokémon, and predicting the opponent's actions.
