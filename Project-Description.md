# Problem Statement
AI struggles to match human skill in diverse Pokémon battles, limiting challenging gaming experiences.

# Inadequacy of current solutions
Existing AI systems for Pokémon battles lack adaptability and struggle to emulate human-level strategies, resulting in predictable and less engaging gameplay experiences.

# Problem Abstract
Our senior design project aims to develop an AI agent capable of playing as a Pokémon trainer using the popular online battle simulator, Pokémon Showdown’s public API. This project leverages the power of reinforcement learning techniques to create a proficient virtual trainer capable of making strategic decisions in a dynamic and competitive environment.

Pokémon Showdown is an online platform that provides a battle simulator for Pokémon games, enabling players to assemble and battle teams of Pokémon in real-time. Our project focuses on enhancing the game-playing experience by implementing a reinforcement learning algorithm to train the AI agent to make strategic decisions, such as selecting moves, switching Pokémon, and predicting the opponent's actions.

# Technical background applicable to the problem
Eric has worked with AI for co-ops in the past and has experience with training reinforcement learning agents using 
PyTorch, which is how we are training the AI agent.

# Approach to Problem
To improve AI performance in Pokémon battles, our team has implemented Double Dueling Deep Q-Network (DDQN) training using Pokémon Showdown battle data. We'll supplement this with self-play and engagements with other players. Testing involves scenarios with clear optimal choices. Our approach will expose the AI to diverse team compositions and battle scenarios to enhance its adaptability across different strategies.
