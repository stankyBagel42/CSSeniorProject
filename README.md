### Justification (Alex)
In the Spring semester, Alex primarily worked on the main project deliverables, namely the User Guide, the poster, and 
part of the final presentation slides. This took easily 15-20 hours, especially given the amount of detail provided in 
the Teams section of the User Guide. He also attended all team meetings held over the course of the semester, which 
amounted to about 10-12 1 hour meetings. He also participated in about 15 hours of testing, both by himself and with 
people not associated with the project to see how the battler performs against regular people. Partial battle stats can 
be accessed in the Notebooks folder.
### Justification (Eric)
In the fall semester, Eric mostly worked on getting the AI environment and training set up. These took about 15-20 
hours to get through since his previous experience in AI didn't transfer to Reinforcement Learning as well. In the 
spring semester Eric was in charge of training the AI agents and making sure they had the right game state input 
(as described [here](game_state.md)). This easily took 25+ hours as there were > 150 agents trained, and the game state 
/ training curriculum was changed a lot over the length of the project.
### Justification (Nick)
In the fall semester, Nick worked on the initial set up of the pokemon showdown server, ensuring that the server could
be run locally, that the agent could interface with the server, and all of the information that we needed the agent to 
have could be pulled from the server. In the spring semester, Nick primarly worked with Eric on the agent's strategic 
decision making skills through changing states and how the agent viewed certain pokemon moves, abilities, and their 
interactions.
