# Starting the Server
Once the environment setup is complete, before running any of the python scripts make sure to start running the Pokémon 
showdown server on localhost by running the following command from the Pokémon showdown submodule directory.

```node pokemon-showdown start --no-security```

*The no-security flag is there so the RL agent users don't need a registered account to connect*
