"Pokémon," short for "Pocket Monsters," is a popular multimedia franchise created by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise was introduced by Nintendo in 1996 and has since become one of the most successful and recognizable brands in the world. The concept of Pokémon revolves around fictional creatures called Pokémon, which humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport.

Key elements of the Pokémon franchise include:

The goal is to catch and train Pokémon, battle other Trainers, and become the Pokémon Champion. The gameplay typically involves exploring various regions, capturing Pokémon, and challenging Gym Leaders and the Pokémon League.

Trading Card Game: The Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) allows players to build decks and engage in strategic battles using Pokémon cards. Each card represents a Pokémon, an attack, an item, or other elements from the Pokémon universe.
