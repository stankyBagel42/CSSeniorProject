# 4.1 The Teams
This section will provide information about the teams that are used in our training environment. Many of these teams were adapted from popular smogon teams of the Gen IV era, while some others were made by us. You might notice that the Pokemon are of varying levels. This is to balance teams with objectively stronger or weaker Pokemon.

Each Pokemon entry will include its nickname (if applicable), item, ability, EVs, nature, and moves.

## The OG
This team was adapted from the oldest entry I could find on the Gen IV smogon forum. I'll include notes from the original author, Aldaron.

### Roserade  
![Roserade](./PokemonImages/Roserade.webp)  
Moves:

- Grass Knot
- Hidden Power Fire
- Sleep Powder
- Toxic Spikes  

Item: Focus Sash  
Ability: Natural Cure  
EVs: 4 Def / 252 Spe / 252 SpA  
Nature: Timid (+ Spd, - Atk)  
> I ended up sticking with Hidden Power Fire as the main move, to deter stall (Skarmory / Forretress primarily) from setting up after allowing a Pokemon to absorb sleep. I also settled on Sleep Powder + Toxic Spikes over Grass Whistle + Spikes because Sleep Powder's accuracy was much more appealing and 1 layer of Toxic Spikes is just a little worse than 1 layer of Spikes for the initial switch in.  

### Swampert
![Swampert](./PokemonImages/Swampert.webp)  
Moves:  

- Ice Beam
- Stealth Rock
- Earthquake
- Hydro Pump  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Torrent  
EVs: 240 HP / 216 Def / 52 SpD  
Nature: Relaxed (+ Def, - SpD)  
> I stuck with Hydro Pump to help me deal more damage to Skarmory again (note the beat stall pattern lol). The EVs help me survive a +2 Outrage from neutral attack nature Garchomp and 2 Life Orb Shadow Balls from Gengar, even after Stealth Rock damage.  

### Gengar
![Gengar](./PokemonImages/Gengar.webp)  
Moves:  

- Shadow Ball
- Focus Blast
- Thunderbolt
- Hidden Power Ice  

Item: Choice Scarf  
Ability: Levitate  
EVs: 4 Def / 252 Spe / 252 SpA  
Nature: Timid (+ Spe, - Atk)  
> Note the Hidden Power Ice lol. Garchomp was *that* much of an issue. Also helped against Dragon Dancing Salamence, I guess, but before Platinum they weren't too much of an issue.  

### Lucario
![Lucario]()  
Moves:  

- Swords Dance
- Close Combat
- Bullet Punch
- Extreme Speed  

Item: Life Orb  
Ability: Inner Focus  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  
Nature: Adamant (+ Atk, - SpA)  
> The main point of this team. Note that while I generally advocate Crunch as the main move for Lucario, on this team I settled on Bullet Punch to help me deal with Aerodactyl and Gengar, both of whom annoy me more than Celebi (or Cresselia / Dusknoir).  

### Infernape
![Infernape]()  
Moves:  

- Close Combat
- Fire Blast
- Thunder Punch
- Hidden Power Ice  

Item: Choice Scarf  
Ability: Blaze  
EVs: 156 Atk / 232 Spe / 120 SpA  
Nature: Naive (+ Spd, - SpD)  
> Hidden Power Ice again, lol. Damn, Garchomp must have been a bitch. This reaches 341 Speed without the Scarf, to allow me to outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Dugtrio and Dragon Dancing Salamence / Gyarados and all Choice Scarf Garchomp. The Special Attack reaches 274, or enough to one-hit KO 4 HP / 0 SpD Garchomp after SR + 1 Toxic Spike turn damage on average. The rest are put into attack so I can deal more damage with Close Combat. In Platinum, I would probably dump Thunder Punch for U-turn and Hidden Power Ice for Stone Edge (as I have for Choice Scarf Infernape on my other teams).  

### Salamence
![Salamence]()  
Moves:  

- Draco Meteor
- Fire Blast
- Brick Break
- Roost  

Item: Life Orb  
Ability: Intimidate  
EVs: 76 Atk / 180 Spe / 252 SpA  
Nature: Rash (+ SpA, - SpD)  
> Classic MixMence, my second favorite Salamence set (after bulky DD roost :P). This team needs something to help deal with general stall, and there isn't much of a better Pokemon than Classic MixMence to do that. I didn't have an explanation in my word document, so my best guess regarding the EVs is that I reach 280 speed to get Heatran and Lucario, max Special Attack and dump the rest into Attack.  

## Stall Team
This is another entry from the smogon forum. This one was created by obi.

### Hippowdon - "Daedalus"
![Hippowdon]()  
Moves:  

- Stealth Rock
- Slack Off
- Earthquake
- Ice Fang  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Sand Stream  
EVs: 252 HP / 24 Atk / 192 Def / 40 SpD  
Nature: Impish (+ Def, - SpA)  
> Putting down Stealth Rock ASAP negates Focus Sash (as does Sand Stream, but some Pokemon are immune to that). Stealth Rock removes the possibility of a Bellyzard sweep with Sand Stream support. The first two parts of my "secondary" damage.  
> To explain the EVs, max HP maximized overall defenses. 192 Def with an Impish nature gives 2 more points than 188, which helps maximize overall physical defensiveness. The 24 Attack guaranteed a certain amount of damage on a Pokemon that I have since forgotten, and the rest went into Special Defense to take stuff like Hidden Power from Electrics.  

### Skarmory - "Icarus"
![Skarmory]()  
Moves:  

- Whirlwind
- Spikes
- Roost
- Brave Bird  

Item: Shed Shell  
Ability: Keen Eye  
EVs: 252 HP / 200 Def / 40 SpD / 16 Spe  
Nature: Impish (+ Def, - SpA)  
> The next part of my "secondary" damage, Spikes. Skarmory has some great resistances to abuse here. It helps Whirlwind out stat-uppers like Curse Miltank and Snorlax, as well as just phazing stuff to rack up Spikes damage. I use Shed Shell because Magnezone is a punk. Brave Bird is needed to do something useful to Starmie, Tentacruel, and Gyarados, 3 big opponents to stall teams who think they can take on Skarmory.  
> I moved those 16 EVs from Attack to Speed on this posting, because that's where they were supposed to be. It's primarily to beat other Skarmory to the WW.  

### Tentacruel - "Morpheus"
![Tentacruel]()  
Moves:  

- Toxic Spikes
- Rapid Spin
- Surf
- Hidden Power Electric  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Liquid Ooze  
EVs: 252 HP / 120 Def / 136 SpD  
Nature: Calm (+ SpD, - Atk)  
> The last part of my "secondary" damage, Toxic Spikes. ~~Rapid Spin + Knock Off is illegal, so I decided on Rapid Spin here.~~ Toxic Spikes means Restless Dusknoir and Spiritomb can't stop me, and Gengar is too frail to keep coming in (and can't OHKO Tentacruel, anyway). Hidden Power Electric helps vs. Empoleon, Starmie, enemy Tentacrual, and Gyarados, mostly, all of shich are more common foes for Tentacrual than Garchomp, Dragonite, Celebi, or Salamence.  

### Blissey - "Helios"
![Blissey]()  
Moves:  

- Wish
- Protect
- Flamethrower
- Toxic  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Natural Cure  
EVs: 252 Def / 40 SpA / 216 SpD  
Nature: Calm (+ SpD, - Atk)  
> Yes, I know what you're thinking, "Calm Blissey with tons of Special Defense EVs!? Are you crazy? Toxic on a team with Toxic Spikes? Are you insane?" Well, yes, I am, but that's irrelevant to this.  
> First, Toxic. 3 of the biggest special attacking threats, Azelf, Togekiss, and Zapdos, are completely immune to Toxic Spikes, and two of those have Roost and/or Wish to heal themselves, meaning Blissey normally can't KO them. With Toxic, Blissey can just hit them with that and start stalling. Wish + Protect helps further with this, so that Blissey can take on that Nasty Plot Aura Sphere Togekiss that thinks it is a Blissey counter because it has Roost.  
> Blissey has all that Special Defense because it needs it. This isn't ADV, people. The level of special attacking power available this generation easily exceeds ADV ubers, and nobody questioned using Special Defense EVs and Calm there (at least not at the end when people realized it isn't OU). Blissey needs Special Defense EVs if it plans to stand up to the likes of Nasty Plot Aura Sphere Togekiss, Focus Blast Gengar, and yes, with this spread, Blissey even has a shot at surviving the much acclaimed Modest Life Orb Nasty Plot Adaptability Hyper Beam PorygonZ (although Blissey isn't usually my first switch into that). It will always survive the same from +SpA Download PorygonZ (although it will sometimes fall to Sandstorm afterward). Blissey needs it to survive Choice Specs Flash Fire Fire Blasts from Heatran.  
> My next big issue here was what form of healing to use on Blissey. In the end, I decided that Tentacruel lacks its own way to heal, so Wish would be useful there. Wish also tends to be passed to the only other member of the team without reliable healing, Spiritomb. If you'll notice, both Tentacruel and Spiritomb resist or are immune to Blissey's weakness, Fighting. So I had to choose between Wish and Softboiled or Wish and Protect. I eschewed Softboiled in favor of Protect for a few reasons. First, Choice Banders love to switch into Blissey when they realize I don't have Thunder Wave, especially Heracross. Protect first, and suddenly they aren't so threatening. Blissey can easily stall that Choice Band Heracross that tries to use Pursuit. Meanwhile, Sandstorm is wearing them down. Protect has also caught so many Gengar, Azelf, Heatran, and Bronzong Explosions for me. Finally, Wish + Protect leaves me vulnerable to a critical hit from something like Aura Sphere Togekiss half as often as Softboiled spamming would for the same amount of Toxistalling.  
> So the only thing left unexplained is my final move, Flamethrower. My options, really, were Seismic Toss, Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, Flamethrower, Grass Knot, Psychic (lol). One requirement was that Blissey had to be able to hit Gengar, or else I'd be weak to a Life Orb Gengar with Focus Punch or Focus Blast, so Seismic Toss and Grass Knot were instantly thrown out. After that, it was just "What kind of stuff likes to switch into Blissey, and what can't Blissey reliably take on with Toxic that it could beat with another move?"  
> If I can't break Abomasnow's Substitutes, I'd have to use Sludge Bomb on Tentacruel, or I'd lose to that. Substitute Raikou could at least be forced out thanks to Celebi, and it would slowly be worn down by Sandstorm and its own Substitutes, if nothing else, so it wasn't as critical as Abomasnow. Blissey is supposed to wall SpecsMence, but it's not going to get through Blissey ever unless it gets 2 CHes or a CH and tons of spike clones are down, and in neither of those cases do I even get a chance to attack, anyway, so as long as I can do something to it, I'll win out in the end. If need be, it can be hit with Toxic, Sandstorm stalled with Protect and Wish, and just generally worn down thanks to Stealth Rock. Physical versions are just going to OHKO Blissey after a set-up or 2HKO with Choice Band Dragon Claw or whatever, so once again, Blissey can't hit it.  
> Heracross, Weavile, Tyranitar, and Lucario like to switch into Blissey. Flamethrower hits 3 of those SE, and barely dents Tyranitar. Thunderbolt is neutral on all (and neutral may as well be NVE for all it does to most of these guys). Ice Beam is resisted by 2 and neutral on the others (ah, that's even worse!). Psychic is SE on Heracross, neutral on Lucario, and doesn't touch Weavile or Tyranitar. Flamethrower obviously has the best coverage for stuff that generally switches into Blissey.  
> Flamethrower has also netted me several Forretress kills and a few Scizor kills. It lets Blissey beat those annoying Skarmory, because it's still SE, even if they Roost.  
> If you'll notice, I cannot touch Heatran at all. However, Heatran is almost always Scarfed or Specsed. This means it's easily PP stalled out of its Fire move (Overheat and Fire Blast have 8 PP). However, I'll still have to kill it eventually. Fortunately, Tentacruel is a Special Defensive beast. The only way Heatran is even considering touching it is with Earth Power, which does pittance to Celebi and less to Skarmory. Without Choice Specs, it won't do enough to Tentacruel in case someone suggests a non-Choice item Heatran as a way to beat my team. I guess I do have a Substitute, Flamethrower, Nasty Plot, HP Electric / HP Ground Houndoom weakness, but whatever.  
> With the rise of Heatran in Platinum (and the fall of guys like Weavile), I would very well consider something like Thunderbolt so I can at least touch Heatran (and thus not instantly lose to Taunt Heatran), because I don't like to overload Tentacruel.  

### Celebi - "Celobi"
![Celebi]()  
Moves:  

- Recover
- Perish Song
- Grass Knot
- U-turn  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Natural Cure  
EVs: 252 HP / 216 Def / 8 SpD / 32 Spe  
Nature: Bold (+ Def, - Atk)  
> Ah, my main Gyarados counter, and the reason I don't lose to last Pokemon <stat-upper that can block toxic in some way>. Also the best answer to Baton Pass chains.  
> Grass Knot obviously works to stop Gyarados(it does about 40% to it, so a 2HKO if it's hit by Stealth Rock, 3HKO otherwise). Meanwhile, the only way Gyarados is hurting Celebi at all is with Ice Fang. If it has DD and Ice Fang, then it lacks EQ, meaning Tentacruel can come in and use Hidden Power Electric for ~50% damage, or it lacks Waterfall, meaning Skarmory has some fun with Brave Bird, or maybe it lacks Taunt, meaning Skarmory can still Roost and Whirlwind, or, as an absolute last resort, Blissey can Toxic. Grass Knot also covers Tyranitar somewhat, and does a surprising amount of damage to Spiritomb (I don't know about Dusknoir because it's not as common). Celebi with Grass Knot laughs in the face of Hippowdon and Swampert, too.  
> Perish Song works as pseudo-phazing, stops BP chains (unless they catch on and Baton Pass Ingrain to Mr. Mime, I guess, but if you got Toxic Spikes down, even that won't fly), and infuriates anything Umbreon tries to pull off. U-Turn lets you switch out and see who they are replacing when they're leaving for fear of Perish Song, and keeps the aforementioned Umbreon from trapping you. I'm still waiting for the day I use U-Turn on the final turn of Perish Song, but they switch to Garchomp, and Sand Veil causes U-Turn to miss, so I end up dying to my own trap.  
> The purpose of the EVs is as follows: maximize HP to maximize overall defenses. 32 Speed beats even Jolly Tyranitar, 216 Def with Bold gives me the extra point, and then I put the rest in Special Defense to take Ice Beams slightly better.  
> This dude, like the rest of my team members, has an awesome nickname, as well.
