# 4.1 The Teams
This section will provide information about the teams that are used in our training environment. Many of these teams were adapted from popular smogon teams of the Gen IV era, while some others were made by us. You might notice that the Pokemon are of varying levels. This is to balance teams with objectively stronger or weaker Pokemon.

Each Pokemon entry will include its nickname (if applicable), item, ability, EVs, nature, and moves.

## The OG
This team was adapted from the oldest entry I could find on the Gen IV smogon forum. I'll include notes from the original author.

Moves:

- Grass Knot
- Hidden Power Fire
- Sleep Powder
- Toxic Spikes  

Item: Focus Sash  
Ability: Natural Cure  
EVs: 4 Def / 252 Spe / 252 SpA  
Nature: Timid (+Spd, -Atk)  
> I ended up sticking with Hidden Power Fire as the main move, to deter stall (Skarmory / Forretress primarily) from setting up after allowing a Pokemon to absorb sleep. I also settled on Sleep Powder + Toxic Spikes over Grass Whistle + Spikes because Sleep Powder's accuracy was much more appealing and 1 layer of Toxic Spikes is just a little worse than 1 layer of Spikes for the initial switch in.
