# 4.1 The Teams
This section will provide information about the teams that are used in our training environment. Many of these teams were adapted from popular smogon teams of the Gen IV era, while some others were made by us. You might notice that the Pokemon are of varying levels. This is to balance teams with objectively stronger or weaker Pokemon.

Each Pokemon entry will include its nickname (if applicable), item, ability, EVs, nature, and moves.

## The OG
This team was made circa November 2007 by Aldaron, during the spike of stall based teams in the metagame. It utilized entry hazards and the extremely hard hitting Lucario and Life Orb Heatran to deal with Stall, and High Speed Choice Scarf Pokemon and priority to deal with offense. It is best noted for "introducing / popularizing" Swords Dance Lucario and Lead Roserade, while re-introducing Choice Scarfing high base Speed Pokemon as a viable and competitively wise strategy.

### Roserade  
![Roserade](./PokemonImages/Roserade.webp)  
Moves:

- Grass Knot
- Hidden Power Fire
- Sleep Powder
- Toxic Spikes  

Item: Focus Sash  
Ability: Natural Cure  
EVs: 4 Def / 252 Spe / 252 SpA  
Nature: Timid (+ Spd, - Atk)  
> I ended up sticking with Hidden Power Fire as the main move, to deter stall (Skarmory / Forretress primarily) from setting up after allowing a Pokemon to absorb sleep. I also settled on Sleep Powder + Toxic Spikes over Grass Whistle + Spikes because Sleep Powder's accuracy was much more appealing and 1 layer of Toxic Spikes is just a little worse than 1 layer of Spikes for the initial switch in.  

### Swampert
![Swampert](./PokemonImages/Swampert.webp)  
Moves:  

- Ice Beam
- Stealth Rock
- Earthquake
- Hydro Pump  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Torrent  
EVs: 240 HP / 216 Def / 52 SpD  
Nature: Relaxed (+ Def, - SpD)  
> I stuck with Hydro Pump to help me deal more damage to Skarmory again (note the beat stall pattern lol). The EVs help me survive a +2 Outrage from neutral attack nature Garchomp and 2 Life Orb Shadow Balls from Gengar, even after Stealth Rock damage.  

### Gengar
![Gengar](./PokemonImages/Gengar.webp)  
Moves:  

- Shadow Ball
- Focus Blast
- Thunderbolt
- Hidden Power Ice  

Item: Choice Scarf  
Ability: Levitate  
EVs: 4 Def / 252 Spe / 252 SpA  
Nature: Timid (+ Spe, - Atk)  
> Note the Hidden Power Ice lol. Garchomp was *that* much of an issue. Also helped against Dragon Dancing Salamence, I guess, but before Platinum they weren't too much of an issue.  

### Lucario
![Lucario]()  
Moves:  

- Swords Dance
- Close Combat
- Bullet Punch
- Extreme Speed  

Item: Life Orb  
Ability: Inner Focus  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  
Nature: Adamant (+ Atk, - SpA)  
> The main point of this team. Note that while I generally advocate Crunch as the main move for Lucario, on this team I settled on Bullet Punch to help me deal with Aerodactyl and Gengar, both of whom annoy me more than Celebi (or Cresselia / Dusknoir).  

### Infernape
![Infernape]()  
Moves:  

- Close Combat
- Fire Blast
- Thunder Punch
- Hidden Power Ice  

Item: Choice Scarf  
Ability: Blaze  
EVs: 156 Atk / 232 Spe / 120 SpA  
Nature: Naive (+ Spd, - SpD)  
> Hidden Power Ice again, lol. Damn, Garchomp must have been a bitch. This reaches 341 Speed without the Scarf, to allow me to outspeed Adamant Choice Scarf Dugtrio and Dragon Dancing Salamence / Gyarados and all Choice Scarf Garchomp. The Special Attack reaches 274, or enough to one-hit KO 4 HP / 0 SpD Garchomp after SR + 1 Toxic Spike turn damage on average. The rest are put into attack so I can deal more damage with Close Combat. In Platinum, I would probably dump Thunder Punch for U-turn and Hidden Power Ice for Stone Edge (as I have for Choice Scarf Infernape on my other teams).  

### Salamence
![Salamence]()  
Moves:  

- Draco Meteor
- Fire Blast
- Brick Break
- Roost  

Item: Life Orb  
Ability: Intimidate  
EVs: 76 Atk / 180 Spe / 252 SpA  
Nature: Rash (+ SpA, - SpD)  
> Classic MixMence, my second favorite Salamence set (after bulky DD roost :P). This team needs something to help deal with general stall, and there isn't much of a better Pokemon than Classic MixMence to do that. I didn't have an explanation in my word document, so my best guess regarding the EVs is that I reach 280 speed to get Heatran and Lucario, max Special Attack and dump the rest into Attack.  

## Stall Team
Obi's stall team is perhaps the most celebrated of all teams in the DPP generation. It is often said that, pre-Platinum, it was hard to make a successful stall team without reducing it to Obistall. The team was especially responsible for Tentacruel's rise from the UU Tier to the OU Tier, as people discovered its niche in the metagame. The huge amount of thought and effort put into the team is apparent in the presentation of the team-building process and the in-depth description of every choice made. This team combines all of the elements needed to create a "full" Stall team, and acts as an excellent example to anyone looking to play the slower game.

### Hippowdon - "Daedalus"
![Hippowdon]()  
Moves:  

- Stealth Rock
- Slack Off
- Earthquake
- Ice Fang  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Sand Stream  
EVs: 252 HP / 24 Atk / 192 Def / 40 SpD  
Nature: Impish (+ Def, - SpA)  
> Putting down Stealth Rock ASAP negates Focus Sash (as does Sand Stream, but some Pokemon are immune to that). Stealth Rock removes the possibility of a Bellyzard sweep with Sand Stream support. The first two parts of my "secondary" damage.  
> To explain the EVs, max HP maximized overall defenses. 192 Def with an Impish nature gives 2 more points than 188, which helps maximize overall physical defensiveness. The 24 Attack guaranteed a certain amount of damage on a Pokemon that I have since forgotten, and the rest went into Special Defense to take stuff like Hidden Power from Electrics.  

### Skarmory - "Icarus"
![Skarmory]()  
Moves:  

- Whirlwind
- Spikes
- Roost
- Brave Bird  

Item: Shed Shell  
Ability: Keen Eye  
EVs: 252 HP / 200 Def / 40 SpD / 16 Spe  
Nature: Impish (+ Def, - SpA)  
> The next part of my "secondary" damage, Spikes. Skarmory has some great resistances to abuse here. It helps Whirlwind out stat-uppers like Curse Miltank and Snorlax, as well as just phazing stuff to rack up Spikes damage. I use Shed Shell because Magnezone is a punk. Brave Bird is needed to do something useful to Starmie, Tentacruel, and Gyarados, 3 big opponents to stall teams who think they can take on Skarmory.  
> I moved those 16 EVs from Attack to Speed on this posting, because that's where they were supposed to be. It's primarily to beat other Skarmory to the WW.  

### Tentacruel - "Morpheus"
![Tentacruel]()  
Moves:  

- Toxic Spikes
- Rapid Spin
- Surf
- Hidden Power Electric  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Liquid Ooze  
EVs: 252 HP / 120 Def / 136 SpD  
Nature: Calm (+ SpD, - Atk)  
> The last part of my "secondary" damage, Toxic Spikes. ~~Rapid Spin + Knock Off is illegal, so I decided on Rapid Spin here.~~ Toxic Spikes means Restless Dusknoir and Spiritomb can't stop me, and Gengar is too frail to keep coming in (and can't OHKO Tentacruel, anyway). Hidden Power Electric helps vs. Empoleon, Starmie, enemy Tentacrual, and Gyarados, mostly, all of shich are more common foes for Tentacrual than Garchomp, Dragonite, Celebi, or Salamence.  

### Blissey - "Helios"
![Blissey]()  
Moves:  

- Wish
- Protect
- Flamethrower
- Toxic  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Natural Cure  
EVs: 252 Def / 40 SpA / 216 SpD  
Nature: Calm (+ SpD, - Atk)  
> Yes, I know what you're thinking, "Calm Blissey with tons of Special Defense EVs!? Are you crazy? Toxic on a team with Toxic Spikes? Are you insane?" Well, yes, I am, but that's irrelevant to this.  
> First, Toxic. 3 of the biggest special attacking threats, Azelf, Togekiss, and Zapdos, are completely immune to Toxic Spikes, and two of those have Roost and/or Wish to heal themselves, meaning Blissey normally can't KO them. With Toxic, Blissey can just hit them with that and start stalling. Wish + Protect helps further with this, so that Blissey can take on that Nasty Plot Aura Sphere Togekiss that thinks it is a Blissey counter because it has Roost.  
> Blissey has all that Special Defense because it needs it. This isn't ADV, people. The level of special attacking power available this generation easily exceeds ADV ubers, and nobody questioned using Special Defense EVs and Calm there (at least not at the end when people realized it isn't OU). Blissey needs Special Defense EVs if it plans to stand up to the likes of Nasty Plot Aura Sphere Togekiss, Focus Blast Gengar, and yes, with this spread, Blissey even has a shot at surviving the much acclaimed Modest Life Orb Nasty Plot Adaptability Hyper Beam PorygonZ (although Blissey isn't usually my first switch into that). It will always survive the same from +SpA Download PorygonZ (although it will sometimes fall to Sandstorm afterward). Blissey needs it to survive Choice Specs Flash Fire Fire Blasts from Heatran.  
> My next big issue here was what form of healing to use on Blissey. In the end, I decided that Tentacruel lacks its own way to heal, so Wish would be useful there. Wish also tends to be passed to the only other member of the team without reliable healing, Spiritomb. If you'll notice, both Tentacruel and Spiritomb resist or are immune to Blissey's weakness, Fighting. So I had to choose between Wish and Softboiled or Wish and Protect. I eschewed Softboiled in favor of Protect for a few reasons. First, Choice Banders love to switch into Blissey when they realize I don't have Thunder Wave, especially Heracross. Protect first, and suddenly they aren't so threatening. Blissey can easily stall that Choice Band Heracross that tries to use Pursuit. Meanwhile, Sandstorm is wearing them down. Protect has also caught so many Gengar, Azelf, Heatran, and Bronzong Explosions for me. Finally, Wish + Protect leaves me vulnerable to a critical hit from something like Aura Sphere Togekiss half as often as Softboiled spamming would for the same amount of Toxistalling.  
> So the only thing left unexplained is my final move, Flamethrower. My options, really, were Seismic Toss, Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, Flamethrower, Grass Knot, Psychic (lol). One requirement was that Blissey had to be able to hit Gengar, or else I'd be weak to a Life Orb Gengar with Focus Punch or Focus Blast, so Seismic Toss and Grass Knot were instantly thrown out. After that, it was just "What kind of stuff likes to switch into Blissey, and what can't Blissey reliably take on with Toxic that it could beat with another move?"  
> If I can't break Abomasnow's Substitutes, I'd have to use Sludge Bomb on Tentacruel, or I'd lose to that. Substitute Raikou could at least be forced out thanks to Celebi, and it would slowly be worn down by Sandstorm and its own Substitutes, if nothing else, so it wasn't as critical as Abomasnow. Blissey is supposed to wall SpecsMence, but it's not going to get through Blissey ever unless it gets 2 CHes or a CH and tons of spike clones are down, and in neither of those cases do I even get a chance to attack, anyway, so as long as I can do something to it, I'll win out in the end. If need be, it can be hit with Toxic, Sandstorm stalled with Protect and Wish, and just generally worn down thanks to Stealth Rock. Physical versions are just going to OHKO Blissey after a set-up or 2HKO with Choice Band Dragon Claw or whatever, so once again, Blissey can't hit it.  
> Heracross, Weavile, Tyranitar, and Lucario like to switch into Blissey. Flamethrower hits 3 of those SE, and barely dents Tyranitar. Thunderbolt is neutral on all (and neutral may as well be NVE for all it does to most of these guys). Ice Beam is resisted by 2 and neutral on the others (ah, that's even worse!). Psychic is SE on Heracross, neutral on Lucario, and doesn't touch Weavile or Tyranitar. Flamethrower obviously has the best coverage for stuff that generally switches into Blissey.  
> Flamethrower has also netted me several Forretress kills and a few Scizor kills. It lets Blissey beat those annoying Skarmory, because it's still SE, even if they Roost.  
> If you'll notice, I cannot touch Heatran at all. However, Heatran is almost always Scarfed or Specsed. This means it's easily PP stalled out of its Fire move (Overheat and Fire Blast have 8 PP). However, I'll still have to kill it eventually. Fortunately, Tentacruel is a Special Defensive beast. The only way Heatran is even considering touching it is with Earth Power, which does pittance to Celebi and less to Skarmory. Without Choice Specs, it won't do enough to Tentacruel in case someone suggests a non-Choice item Heatran as a way to beat my team. I guess I do have a Substitute, Flamethrower, Nasty Plot, HP Electric / HP Ground Houndoom weakness, but whatever.  
> With the rise of Heatran in Platinum (and the fall of guys like Weavile), I would very well consider something like Thunderbolt so I can at least touch Heatran (and thus not instantly lose to Taunt Heatran), because I don't like to overload Tentacruel.  

### Celebi - "Celobi"
![Celebi]()  
Moves:  

- Recover
- Perish Song
- Grass Knot
- U-turn  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Natural Cure  
EVs: 252 HP / 216 Def / 8 SpD / 32 Spe  
Nature: Bold (+ Def, - Atk)  
> Ah, my main Gyarados counter, and the reason I don't lose to last Pokemon <stat-upper that can block toxic in some way>. Also the best answer to Baton Pass chains.  
> Grass Knot obviously works to stop Gyarados(it does about 40% to it, so a 2HKO if it's hit by Stealth Rock, 3HKO otherwise). Meanwhile, the only way Gyarados is hurting Celebi at all is with Ice Fang. If it has DD and Ice Fang, then it lacks EQ, meaning Tentacruel can come in and use Hidden Power Electric for ~50% damage, or it lacks Waterfall, meaning Skarmory has some fun with Brave Bird, or maybe it lacks Taunt, meaning Skarmory can still Roost and Whirlwind, or, as an absolute last resort, Blissey can Toxic. Grass Knot also covers Tyranitar somewhat, and does a surprising amount of damage to Spiritomb (I don't know about Dusknoir because it's not as common). Celebi with Grass Knot laughs in the face of Hippowdon and Swampert, too.  
> Perish Song works as pseudo-phazing, stops BP chains (unless they catch on and Baton Pass Ingrain to Mr. Mime, I guess, but if you got Toxic Spikes down, even that won't fly), and infuriates anything Umbreon tries to pull off. U-Turn lets you switch out and see who they are replacing when they're leaving for fear of Perish Song, and keeps the aforementioned Umbreon from trapping you. I'm still waiting for the day I use U-Turn on the final turn of Perish Song, but they switch to Garchomp, and Sand Veil causes U-Turn to miss, so I end up dying to my own trap.  
> The purpose of the EVs is as follows: maximize HP to maximize overall defenses. 32 Speed beats even Jolly Tyranitar, 216 Def with Bold gives me the extra point, and then I put the rest in Special Defense to take Ice Beams slightly better.  
> This dude, like the rest of my team members, has an awesome nickname, as well.  

### Spiritomb - "The Man Who Was Thursday"
![Spiritomb]()  
Moves:  

- Shadow Ball
- Rest
- Sleep Talk
- Hidden Power Fighting  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Pressure  
EVs: 252 HP / 100 Def / 156 SpD  
Nature: Calm (+ SpD, - Atk)  
> Blocks Rapid Spin, counters Lucario and other fighters. Absorbs Sleep, too. Spiritomb can just wall most stall teams that I've faced.  

## Teacher's Out
This team revolves around using the move Substitute, which creates a proxy Pokemon that blocks for the user at the cost of 25% of its HP.  

### Garchomp
![Garchomp]()  
Moves:  

- Substitute
- Swords Dance
- Dragon Claw
- Earthquake  

Item: Salac Berry  
Ability: Sand Veil  
EVs: 252 Atk / 4 SpD / 252 Spe  
Nature: Jolly  

### Gengar
![Gengar]()  
Moves:  

- Substitute
- Pain Split
- Shadow Ball
- Focus Blast  

Item: Black Sludge  
Ability: Levitate  
EVs: 4 Def / 252 SpA / 252 Spe  
Nature: Timid  

### Togekiss
![Togekiss]()  
Moves:  

- Substitute
- Defog
- Body Slam
- Air Slash  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Serene Grace  
EVs: 252 HP / 188 Def / 68 SpD  
Nature: Bold  

### Breloom
![Breloom]()  
Moves:  

- Substitute
- Spore
- Leech Seed
- Focus Punch  

Item: Toxic Orb  
Ability: Poison Heal  
EVs: 252 HP / 48 Atk / 208 Def  
Nature: Adamant  

### Machamp
![Machamp]()  
Moves:  

- Substitute
- Dynamic Punch
- Payback
- Stone Edge  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: No Guard  
EVs: 128 HP / 252 Atk / 128 Spe  
Nature: Adamant  

### Jirachi
![Jirachi]()  
Moves:  

- Substitute
- Calm Mind
- Thunderbolt
- Psychic  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Serene Grace  
EVs: 252 HP / 80 SpA / 176 Spe  
Nature: Timid  

## We Are The Machampions!
This team is designed to abuse paralysis and what is popularly termed as "hax" by working off paralysis support with confusion-inducing and flinching moves. The team is very balanced, with defensive Pokemon such as Jirachi and Blissey coupled with heavy offense in Dragon Dance Gyarados and Choice Band Tyranitar, and when these elements are combined with paralysis support, a powerful core is formed. This team is the epitome of strategy-based teams; rather than solely worrying about countering and checking the top threats of the metagame, Obi forms a core strategy and attempts to execute it regardless of the opponent's one.

### Jirachi - "Homeland Security"
![Jirachi]()  
Moves:  

- Stealth Rock
- Wish
- Zen Headbutt
- Body Slam  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Serene Grace  
EVs: 252 HP / 8 Atk / 216 Def / 32 Spe  
Nature: Impish (+ Def, - SpA)  
> Jirachi is pretty cool. I like Stealth Rock because it's awesome and helps vs. enemy trainers trying to just switch around a lot. Body Slam has 60% chance to Paralyze, which royally screws over BPers. I love it when Garchomp comes in, thinking it has a safe switch, only to be nailed by a paralysis, which really puts a damper on its ability to sweep. Jirachi takes Dragon moves, mostly. Body Slam + Zen Headbutt + Serene Grace = they aren't moving very much.  

### Machamp - "Big Brother"
![Machamp]()  
Moves:  

- Dynamic Punch
- Rest
- Sleep Talk
- Ice Punch  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: No Guard  
EVs: 252 HP / 220 Atk / 36 Def  
Nature: Adamant (+ Atk, - SpA)  
> When everyone is paralyzed, Machamp is probably moving first. Dynamic Punch gives guaranteed confusion, which is 50% shot to hit yourself in your confusion. Add in Paralysis and you have one mean fighter. I used to use Rock Slide in the last slot becuase I liked the flich thing and it has more PP than Stone Edge, but in the end Gliscor proved to be too annoying. It's easier to take down Gyarados and the like, because they are less likely to have Rest vs. Gliscor almost always having Roost.  

### Tyranitar - "FBI"
![Tyranitar]()  
Moves:  

- Pursuit
- Earthquake
- Stone Edge
- Crunch  

Item: Choice Band  
Ability: Sand Stream  
EVs: 252 HP / 252 Atk / 4 SpD  
Nature: Adamant  
> I Pursuit those annoying Ghosts, Cresselia, and Aromatherapy Blissey with this guy. I never use Stone Edge unless I need it for a OHKO, because I hate missing. I'm considering Rock Slide, but then it's weaker than Crunch, and sometimes you need that extra kick.  

### Blissey - "NSA"
![Blissey]()  
Moves:  

- Thunder Wave
- Softboiled
- Flamethrower
- Hidden Power Ground  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Natural Cure  
EVs: 252 Def / 80 SpA / 176 SpD  
Nature: Calm (+ SpD, - Atk)  
> I've been using Grass Knot, but I find that I usually want Hidden Power Ground. My three main hang-ups with that are Tyranitar (not hit as hard by Hidden Power Ground compared to Grass Knot), Starmie (if it has Surf, Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, Recover, it can be annoying, otherwise Celebi, Tyranitar, or Gyarados beat it handily, depending on what attack it drops for Rapid Spin), and Roaring Blizzard Walrein (without Roar, Gyarados sets up, and without Blizzard, Celebi takes it down), although Jirachi can take on Walrein easy, it can get worn down with Spikes on my side. Roar Swampert can also be a pest. Hidden Power Ground would let me do something to Infernape once I get it paralyzed, decimates Heatran, does something to Tentacruel, and has a lot of other cool uses. I find myself in need of HP Ground more than I use Grass Knot, but some of the Grass Knot foes are big trouble if I can't stop them.  

### Celebi - "Secret Service"
![Celebi]()  
Moves:  

- Grass Knot
- Hidden Power Ice
- Recover
- Thunder Wave  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Natural Cure  
EVs: 252 HP / 220 Def / 4 SpD / 32 Spe  
Nature: Bold (+Def, -Atk)  
> Grass Knot and Hidden Power Ice hit just about everything immune to Thunder Wave for SE damage. The only exceptions I can think of are Limber Pokemon (who are mostly Fighters, who pretty much lose to Celebi regardless), Steelix, and Camerupt. The only reason I have HP Ice over Psychic is because of Garchomp, who Celebi takes on surprisingly well.  

### Gyarados - "CIA"
![Gyarados]()  
Moves:  

- Rest
- Sleep Talk
- Waterfall
- Dragon Dance  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Intimidate  
EVs: 252 HP / 176 Atk / 60 Def / 20 Spe  
Nature: Adamant  
> This guy is pretty cool. Late game, I consider what kind of team they have. If I'm having trouble breaking their stall, for instance, I'll kill off every other member of my team to kill their Celebi, Charge Beam Cresselia, and Thunderbolt Starmie, and then just DD up for free with Gyarados as they are now unable to phaze me. I need Gyarados to take on Fighters and such, especially Infernape. I'm considering Moltres with a set like Flamethrower, HP Ice, Substitute, Roost in this slot. I used to have Ice Fang over Dragon Dance for Garchomp, but I decided DD is actually lot better to take on non-SD Chomp. I'm thinking of lowering its Attack to make it bulkier. The main reason I am using Gyarados over Moltres is Intimidate, really, and the 2x Rock weakness instead of 4x.  

## Team Astral Projection
A pre-Platinum offense team that featured both Garchomp and Deoxys-S. At the time, the Wobbuffet test was also being conducted. The team itself was posted almost to prove the point that pure offense teams could still dominate, despite the Speed and type coverage that the newly OU Deoxys-S could use to threaten such teams. This team provided pressure from the get go, with well placed resistances being used to repeatedly get in an advantageous position against the opponent. The team worked mainly around intelligent prediction, and husk was sure to point this out in the "Team Work" sections of his write up. This way, he was able to show those who rated the team exactly how he used combinations of the Pokemon in his team to beat certain problematic threats.  

### Aerodactyl
![Aerodactyl]()  
Moves:  

- Stealth Rock
- Taunt
- Rock Slide
- Earthquake  

Item: Focus Sash  
Ability: Pressure  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  
Nature: Jolly (+Spe, -SpA)  
> Aerodactyl is a great lead. He usually gets off a quick SR and can often cripple leading pokes such as Salamence/Gyarados/Garchomp/Azelf. Slower leads are generally there to SR so he'll taunt them to keep the rocks off. I had Stone Edge over Rock Slide and Ice Fang over Earthquake but I found that I missed far too often with both for them to be useful. I also realized I had a Metagross problem so the more ground attacks, the better.  

### Gyarados
![Gyarados]()  
Moves:  

- Dragon Dance
- Earthquake
- Ice Fang
- Waterfall  

Item: Life Orb  
Ability: Intimidate  
EVs: 80 HP / 252 Atk / 176 Spe  
Nature: Adamant (+Atk, -SpA)  
> This set is fairly self-explanitory. After a Dragon Dance, few things can stand up to this. This 2HKOs Celebi and with Stealth Rock down often OHKOs Starmie. Cresselia is 2 or 3HKO'd and so is Skarmory. If this gets a Dragon Dance in, my opponenet generally loses at least one very valuable member of their defensive core which is very important as most of those Pokemon are used to counter multiple threats.  

### Gengar
![Gengar]()  
Moves:  

- Shadow Ball
- Explosion
- Focus Blast
- Hypnosis  

Item: Life Orb  
Ability: Levitate  
EVs: 40 Atk / 252 Spe / 216 SpA  
Nature: Timid  
> Shadow Ball/Focus Blast hit everything neutrally and Hypnosis + Explosion basically guarantees that Gengar will take two Pokemon out of the match. Life Orb moves a lot of 3HKOs to 2HKOs which is extremely important for Gengar as with a little prediction you may manage to die from 10 turns of Life Orb recoil rather than your opponent's attacks.  

### Garchomp
![Garchomp]()  
Moves:  

- Earthquake
- Dragon Claw
- Fire Fang
- Outrage  

Item: Choice Band  
Ability: Sand Veil  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  
Nature: Adamant (+Atk, -SpA)  
> This thing is absolutely amazing. There really isn't much this doesn't straight up 2HKO with Stealth Rock down so if my opponent switches, I should net a KO unless I predict incorrectly.  

### Lucario
![Lucario]()  
Moves:  

- Close Combat
- Swords Dance
- Bullet Punch
- Extremespeed  

Item: Life Orb  
Ability: Inner Focus  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  
Nature: Adamant (+Atk, -SpA)  
> Lucario tears stuff up with or without using Swords Dance. Bullet Punch is used instead of Crunch as Dusknoir, Celebi, and Cresselia are usually overwhelmed by the offense on this team while opposing Gengars and Mismagius' are a very serious threat. Life Orb is required as a Swords Danced Bullet Punch doesn't OHKO Gengar otherwise.  

### Deoxys-Speed
![Deoxys-S]()  
Moves:  

- Ice Beam
- Thunderbolt
- Superpower
- Shadow Ball  

Item: Life Orb  
Ability: Pressure  
EVs: 4 Atk / 252 Spe / 252 SpA  
Nature: Naive (+Spe, -SpD)  
> Shadow Ball is placed over Psychic and Recover as I have trouble with Psychic types. Shadow Ball also helps me revenge kill nonscarfed Garchomp.  

## Team Antimatter
This team was built early on in the Platinum release. It ultimately demonstrated how powerful Scarf Skymin (Shaymin-Sky) could be, both as a lead and as a late-game sweeper. Kevin Garrett and Limitless picked every Pokemon for a certain reason, to counter or check opposing offensive teams. They did this in a style not too many teams had used at this point, but is now abundantly seen. Using fast, bulky Pokemon to gain the upper hand swiftly, it allowed them to maintain this advantage for the rest of the game. This team also helped display the power of Dragon Dance Kingdra as its sweep was the final objective of the team.  

### Shaymin-S
![Shaymin-S]()  
Moves:  

- Seed Flare
- Air Slash
- Earth Power
- Hidden Power Fire  

Item: Choice Scarf  
Ability: Serene Grace  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Spe / 252 SpA  
Nature: Modest (+SpA, -Atk)  
> Scarf Shaymin has unparalleled speed. Since this variation can't overwhelm its counters, it is used as an anti-lead and late-game sweeper. Aside from Air Slash, which can occasionally chain flinches, it isn't meant to be a staying power (more like a trump card). Seed Flare 2HKOs Zapdos with Stealth Rock in play, providing a special defense drop is applied. Earth Power is mainly for fooling Heatran and Hidden Power Fire takes care of Scizor, Skarmory, etc.  

### Mamoswine
![Mamoswine]()  
Moves:  

- Stealth Rock
- Stone Edge
- Ice Shard
- Earthquake  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Snow Cloak  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  
Nature: Jolly (+Spe, -SpA)  
> Mamoswine's main function is to set up Stealth Rock. After that, its role varies based on the situation of the match. Stone Edge is useful damage to get on Rotom or Zapdos. Ice Shard tames Salamence and other threats like Shaymin. Earthquake works great against Adamant Lucario, non-scarfed Heatran, and Tyranitar.  

### Infernape
![Infernape]()  
Moves:  

- Close Combat
- Hidden Power Ice
- Fire Blast
- Grass Knot  

Item: Life Orb  
Ability: Blaze  
EVs: 24 Atk / 232 Spd / 252 SpA  
Nature: Naive  
> Infernape is the wall breaker on this team. Many teams find themselves in a pickle confronting this guy after their Pokemon have been weakened. Close Combat covers Blissey and does a significant amount of damage to many neutral Pokemon. Hidden Power Ice takes care of Gliscor and Salamence without a Scarf or Dragon Dance. Fire Blast is usually the attack of choice since it does a number on Zapdos, Rotom, and Skarmory. If Cresselia has seen anything more than 1 Stealth Rock, then it can't typically switch in on an Infernape's Fire Blast. Grass Knot offers important Water- and Ground-type coverage to an extent. Its main use is against Swampert and Weakened Hippowdon and Milotic.  

### Zapdos
![Zapdos]()  
Moves:  

- Thunderbolt
- Heat Wave
- Roost
- Hidden Power Grass  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Pressure  
EVs: 252 HP / 220 Def / 36 Spe  
Nature: Calm (+SpD, -Atk)  
> Zapdos really got a major boost from all of the Platinum updates with the addition of Heat Wave. Hidden Power Grass is for the obvious Swampert, which my team does not like in stall wars. This spot used to be held by Scizor, however with so many Heatrans present, it kind of was a nuisance.  

### Heatran
![Heatran]()  
Moves:  

- Fire Blast
- Hidden Power Ice
- Earth Power
- Explosion  

Item: Choice Scarf  
Ability: Flash Fire  
EVs: 252 Spe / 252 SpA / 4 HP  
Nature: Naive (+Spe, -SpD)  
> Like for most teams Heatran gives speed and resistances all in one. Fire Blast is for Stab and the occasional Flash Fire bonus. Hidden Power Ice for the obvious Dragons and for any time that I don’t feel like risking a accuracy hax miss from Fire Blast. Explosion is for last case scenarios.  

### Kingdra
![Kingdra]()  
Moves:  

- Dragon Dance
- Substitute
- Waterfall
- Outrage  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Sniper  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  
Nature: Adamant (+Atk, -SpA)  
> I must thank all of you who don’t use Substitute on Kingdra. For I get off so many Subs. when people try to status Kingdra whether it be for burn, sleep, or paralysis. It also shields me from the ever so popular Ghosts trying to use Trick on Kingdra when I am setting up. Dragon Dance, Waterfall, and Outrage are self explanatory.  

## Team Raikoulover
This team was build when Garchomp was still dominating the OU scene. It's a balanced team focused around Calm Mind Jirachi whose purpose is to set up a late-game Jirachi sweep. RaikouLover shows once again his aptitute to make unconventional but still successful sets by proposing innovative builds for both Yanmega and Heatran. The team makes great use of Life Orb Heatran, which serves multiple purposes: setting up Stealth Rock, eliminating Steel-types like Metagross and luring in Blissey to explode on her. The RMT is well presented and the Pokemon descriptions are very detailed, explaining the choice of movesets and EV spreads, the threat list is synthetic but satisfying.

### Yanmega - "Iggybot"
![Yanmega]()  
Moves:  

- Bug Buzz
- Hidden Power Ground
- Hypnosis
- Protect  

Item: Focus Sash  
Ability: Speed Boost  
EVs: 104 Def / 152 Spe / 252 SpA  
Nature: Modest  
> This is my rather unique Yanmega set that I theorized would work in tandem with Jirachi. Yanmega makes a fantastic lead with focus sash to begin with, being able to get at least 2 hits on something with its powerful Bug Buzz or incapacitating something with Hypnosis. Yanmega is one of the best scouting pokemon in the game, because of hypnosis and speed boost. Leading with Yanmega immediately lets you know what kind of team your opponent has by what they switch in. Zapdos and Blissey switch-ins usually indicate a bulky stallish team (obviously), and thinks like Gyarados or Salamence switch ins indicate they really have nothing better to switch in because it is highly offensive!  
>
> Now, what you first notice about my wierd set is the EV spread. I've been using Yanmega for a while and always found it deceptively bulky with its 86 / 86 base HP and defense. After learning months ago that a 4HP Yanmega could survive a +2 Lucario Extremespeed, I wanted to expand on that bulk and tested this new EV spread. Max attack is always necessary on Yanmega, but speed is something I always thought wasn't as important because of his ability. 152 Speed EVs allows for 264 speed, which allows me to outspeed Aerodactyl and Jolteon after my first speed boost. The second speed boosts makes me faster than everything except Positive natured Base 115s with a Choice Scarf, and any further speed boosts are irrelevant. Because I have protect AND focus sash, the absolute worst case scenario is that I am guarenteed my two speed boosts. Furthermore, the 104 Def EVs give me a nice 234 Defense, which allows me to take less than 80% from a +2 Lucario Extremespeed. While countering Lucario isn't the purpose of the EVs, I noticed over many battles that it can survive things like a CB Meteor Mash or Ice Punch from Metagross. Things like Bronzong's Gyro Ball now are 3HKOs thanks to lower speed and greater defense meaning I can beat him one on one after I switch Yanmega in on the predicted Stealth Rock. Weavile also needs a damage boosting item in order to 2HKO with Ice Shard.  
>
> So enough about the EV spread. The moveset is designed to lure out and destroy Heatran and Magnezone, two of Jirachi's decent counters. Yanmega naturally will put a large enough dent into Tyranitar or put it to sleep, and will always sweep right through Garchomp as Bug Buzz is a 2HKO unless he packs a good investment of HP EVs. So, after my opponenet sees me use Bug Buzz, Protect, and Hypnosis, they immediately assume Air Slash is the last slot and bring Heatran and Magnezone into impending doom. I thought I would miss Air Slash, but this set has been working fine without it. Most of the time, Yanmega is usually dead before they notice I don't have it because he can bluff it so well (who would leave a precious fighting pokemon to be air slashed?). As for a bulky flying Pokemon, I just put them to sleep. Protect is a move that should be used with caution on Yanmega because people predict it. I almost never use it in the beginning, as it's best to save it for the late game after Stealth Rock has ruined the sash.  
>
> Yanmega is named after Iggybot because he shares my love of the bug!  

### Heatran - "Blue Kirby"
![Heatran]()  
Moves:  

- Flamethrower
- Earth Power
- Stealth Rock
- Explosion  

Item: Life Orb  
Ability: Flash Fire  
EVs: 4 Atk / 252 Spe / 252 SpA  
Nature: Hasty  
> This is a very simple but effective Heatran build. Heatran has the valuable resists to get in and the offensive potential to force a switch. This makes him a good candidate for Stealth Rock as I further scout my opponent. I haven't seen a fellow Life Orb Heatran all month so I like to consider this unique!  
>
> Flamethrower is obvious STAB, and hurts like hell from Heatran. Earth Power is obvious coverage and slaying Heatrans. Its funny how many Heatran switch in after I Stealth Rock assuming I'm choiced and will switch out, only to fall to an Earth Power. And my Hasty nature allows me outspeed all non-Choice Scarf Heatrans. Explosion is a marvelous move... we all know why! But Heatran is one of the best Exploders in the game as far as targets go. Think of what he lures in... Bulky Waters, Gyarados, Salamence, Blissey, Garchomp... all are great things to take out on a predicted switch, or just the next turn for the slower ones. And surprisingly, Exploding on those pokemon lets me bring back Yanmega again to abuse my opponent.
>
> Heatran is named after Blue Kirby because he's a cool guy and I couldn't think of what Pokemon he would like... sorry bud.  

### Bronzong - "Matty"
![Bronzong]()  
Moves:  

- Gyro Ball
- Reflect
- Light Screen
- Explosion  

Item: Light Clay  
Ability: Levitate  
EVs: 252 HP / 148 Atk / 108 SpD  
Nature: Relaxed  
> Bronzong is the best Pokemon in the game. No seriously! Nothing is more dependable. A team of mine without some version of Bronzong is blasphemy. Bronzong is a great transition switch to so many Pokemon, and can use the turn of switch out to set up an 8 turn screen for the team. His screens are invaluable to the success and further aid Jirachi in helping it set up... breaking those subs can be a pain with double screens up.  
>
> Gyro Ball is obviously for STAB and faster threats such as Azelf, Deoxys-E, Gengar, and Yanmega. Explosion is my favorite move in the game, so it always has a spot. The attack EVs net a KO on Gengar after Stealth Rock, with a good chance even without it. It also gives Explosion quite a bang. The Special Defense EVs raise his Special Defense a point higher than his Physical defense, which is a habit I have settled into after being swept by a Download Porygon-Z many months ago.  
>
> Bronzong is named after Matty because he is dependable.  

### Gyarados - "Seven Deadly Sins"
![Gyarados]()  
Moves:  

- Waterfall
- Stone Edge
- Rest
- Sleep Talk  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Intimidate  
EVs: 216 HP / 252 Def / 40 SpD  
Nature: Impish  
> Gyarados is just as good of a defensive Pokemon as it is offensive. It is invaluable to this team and its synergy and can tank hits like a stud! With screens he's near impenetrable. He is commonly my first line of defense against most offensive threats (screens are my 2nd line of defense) and he is able to switch in and threaten (close to counter!) or at least hit Lucario, Heracross, Infernape, Garchomp, and many others.  
>
> The set itself is pretty straightforward. Water / Rock is good type coverage, and Stone Edge allows him to counter other Gyarados', as they fail to OHKO after Stealth Rock even with a Life Orb, and I deal near fatal damage back to them. Most Gyarados though, come in on Bronzong and get a screen put in front of them (in that case they lose to mine outright), or they come in on Heatran and if I feel up to it I blow up on them. The EV spread allows for 385 HP, a good lefties number, maxed Defense for tanking, and the rest were put into Special Defense because Gyarados takes special hits very well. Those Special Defense EVs turn Yanmega's Air slash into a definite 4HKO. I used to run 120 Speed EVs to outspeed 4 Speed Gliscors, but people are catching onto Lucario and started using Speed EVs :-(.  
>
> Gyarados is named after Seven Deadly Sins because I was chatting with him when I built this team and I needed another person to name a Pokemon after.  

### Garchomp - "Justinawe"
![Garchomp]()  
Moves:  

- Outrage
- Dragon Claw
- Earthquake
- Fire Blast  

Item: Choice Scarf  
Ability: Sand Veil  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  
Nature: Adamant  
> What is an OU team without Garchomp? Garchomp in my opinion is *the* best Choice Scarfer in the game and is his best set. Garchomp has good enough attack moves and stats to effectively make use of the Scarf, and gamebreaking speed because of it. More importantly, Choice Scarf Garchomp helps get through a ton of threats that would otherwise compromise my defensive security. He finishes off those Gyarados that are limping if they get past mine, and is a great "check" against itself. Choice Scarfed Garchomp used to shatter offensive teams until that damned Deoxys-E started polluting the metagame, so I have to use Dragon Claw and carefully pick off threats one by one instead of Outraging recklessly. Thanks to Bronzong's screens, I can still do that every once in a while...  
>
> Since we all know how this works, there's no need for much explanation. Garchomp has excellent synergy with Gyarados, as Gyarados can switch in on things like Gengar's Hypnosis or Starmie's Surf and lure out a Thunderbolt while Chomp comes in and Dragon Claws or Outrages for the KO. Happens a dozen times a day.  
>
> Garchomp is named after Justinawe because he's a cool guy and a strong battler.  

### Jirachi - "Wdro"
![Jirachi]()  
Moves:  

- Psychic
- Thunderbolt
- Substitute
- Calm Mind  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Serene Grace  
EVs: 252 HP / 176 Spe / 80 SpA  
Nature: Timid  
> Ahhh, the star of the show (pun intended). This set is so efficient and so good, and guarantees "Game Over" once people's only counter is eliminated. I usually bring him in relatively early and Calm Mind to scout the counter (without sacrificing HP) so I know what to get past for later.  
>
> This is a standard set, 101 HP Substitutes for Bliss, 308 Speed for Lucario, Roserade, and 95% of Salamences, and 80 Special Attack helps beat Calm Blisseys.  
>
> Jirachi is named after Wdro, for watching him haul ass with this set for about... 10 months.  
## The Dark Passenger
This team utilizes the classic duo of Salamence and Magnezone, combining them with Gengar as a lure. Steel types that can revenge Salamence are lured in from the unique mystic Gengar set, which utilizes protect to help against its normal counters. Magnezone traps and removes these steels which hinder Salamence from sweeping with Dragon Dance and Outrage. These three are supported with a solid combination of defense and offense that leaves few weaknesses in the team.  

### Salamence - "The Bastard"
![Salamence]()  
Moves:  

- Outrage
- Earthquake
- Dragon Dance
- Roost  

Item: Life Orb  
Ability: Intimidate  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  
Nature: Jolly (+Spe, -SpA)  
> I started this team out, as I start out many teams, by asking myself one question: What is the most dangerous Pokemon in the game? And, as quite often happens, Salamence comes to mind, so all I had to do was choose a set. After immersing myself in Mixmence for a long while, I realized 2 things: Salamence can easily cause switches to take advantage of a chance to Roost, and I wish he had a stat upping move for things like Vaporeon that try to stall out Mixmence. Then it hit me: Salamence did have a stat upping move, in the awesome Dragon Dance. Knowing Salamence's awesome typing would allow me to easily set up against some choiced users, and that being able to Roost and set up against things like some Vaporeon and Celebi, I decided that I needed Roost, which Mixmence taught me was very viable. Nature wise, I pretty much had to have Jolly to sweep past things that try to outspeed me, like scarf Jirachi and Flygon. Item-wise, I realized the reason I had never made a great Dragon Dance-mence team before was because I was using it wrong. Using Life Orb allows Salamence to hit incredibly hard, after a Dragon Dance it hits with 1.95x as much power as unboosted. any item cannot possibly top that, not even Lum or Yache Berry which can net me a boost of 2x. The way I play this guy is to just hold him off until late game, then try to sweep with just Life Orb Outrages and Roost. If I ever get in a Dragon Dance, that should just be an automatic win button.  

### Gengar - "Dark Passenger"
![Gengar]()  
Moves:  

- Shadow Ball
- Focus Blast
- Hidden Power Fire
- Protect  

Item: Life Orb  
Ability: Levitate  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 Spe / 252 SpA  
Nature: Timid (+Spe, -Atk)  
> I decided I needed a sweeping partner for Salamence. I also needed to start thinking about eliminating Salamence's counters. The first Salamence check that came to mind was Scizor, so I needed a surefire way to beat it. Enter Mystic Gengar with thanks to Blue Kirby and Aldaron. Gengar is my favorite Pokemon of all time. Protect (as opposed to sub) allows me to always beat Scizor (well not SD Scizor) as well as hit really hard (I can OHKO Salamence after Stealth Rock with Shadow Ball). I wanted something with speed and the ability to hit hard immediately, since Salamence was the set-up sweeper. Other options were Latias or Starmie. I never even seriously considered the other options to be honest, as Gengar will absolutely bait Scizor into either Bullet Punch or Pursuit and not U-turn allowing me to Hidden Power Fire or switch. As a bonus, this guy acts as a decent Lucario check with Focus Blast OHKOing 70% of the time and Hidden Power Fire doing 70% or OHKOing after a defense drop.  

### Magnezone - "Balls of Steel"
![Magnezone]()  
Moves:  

- Thunderbolt
- Hidden Power Grass
- Substitute
- Explosion  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Magnet Pull  
EVs: 42 HP / 214 Spe / 252 SpA  
Nature: Naive (+Spd, -SpD)  
> The absolute key to the team. If Magnezone does his job, I will not lose. So, what happens when Scizor uses Bullet Punch and not Pursuit? I switch to Magnezone for the steel trap. So, not I can eliminate Scizor and almost all steels for Salamence, allowing Salamence to run Roost. But that just isn't good enough. How am I also supposed to open up a sweep for Gengar? The only Pokemon that can really wall Gengar is Blissey, and if it also has to wall Magnezone, it wouldn't be alive when Gengar comes out to play. No one expects Explosion from behind a Sub, making Magnezone the perfect Blissey lure. What if Skarmory has shed shell? No problem. If I know it's going to switch out, I can just Substitute on the switch and proceed to attack while behind a Sub. Once Blissey is gone, Gengar can start damaging things (such as those Shed Shell steels), clearing the way for a Salamence sweep. Thunderbolt over discharge, since without Modest, Discharge is too weak. Hidden Power Grass to kill Swampert who can beat Salamence 1 on 1 (barely). Nature and spread is to outspeed all Scizor, acting as a 70% Scizor check. As a bonus, I can trap those annoying Scarfrachi, which can beat Salamence. Best case scenario, this guy traps a steel and kills it, gets behind a Sub in the meantime and hits something else like Heatran, Swampert, or Infernape hard, or explosed and kills Blissey. This guy will get 2 kills on a good day.  

### Vaporeon - "Boy Blue"
![Vaporeon]()  
Moves:  

- Wish
- Protect
- Surf
- Hidden Power Electric  

Item: Leftovers  
Ability: Water Absorb  
EVs: 188 HP / 252 Def / 70 Spe  
Nature: Bold (+Def, -Atk)  
> The second answer to my question of "what is the most dangerouse Pokemon in the game?" is often Gyarados. However, unlike Salamence, Gyarados can have some hard counters. For this reason, I often find myself using Vaporeon quite often, who also counters Infernape, who is in the top 5 on my list. Vaporeon plays as the defensive anchor of the team, countering key threats, such as eliminating Gyarados whose Intimidate can ruin my Salamence sweep and taking out Heatran or Infernape who can threaten Magnezone. Wish allows me to heal other teammates, even allowing Gengar to often get a second chance at a sweep. For anyone who asks, the speed is to outspeed most Scizors and Skarmory, allowing me to do some damage or Wish on the U-turn. She's a girl despite the name for people who use Attract, with males being the more common gender as it's the default.  

### Scizor - "Iron Man VI"
![Scizor]()  
Moves:  

- Bullet Punch
- U-turn
- Superpower
- Pursuit  

Item: Choice Band  
Ability: Technician  
EVs: 198 HP / 252 Atk / 60 Spe  
Nature: Adamant (+Atk, -SpA)  
> The definition of a bulky Pokemon, and for a Pokemon ranked #1 in usage, I have no idea how I didn't use him before this. Since I run Hidden Power Fire on my Gengar, I lose my chance to tie with opposing Gengar, meaning I needed a solid switch into the Dark Passenger. Also allows me to trap Latias, who can threaten my Salamence sweep if it has a scarf or if I can't find a chance to Dragon Dance up with Salamence. Also acts as my Salamence check thanks to Bullet Punch. Lastly, Scizor works as my initial physical switch into Blissey in case Blissey gets in on Gengar before Magnezone has had a chance to explode on it. Despite all this, I most often just spam U-turns. It surpsises me that most people don't know how to use Scizor properly. I do not bring out Scizor early game to Bullet Punch, in fear of Magnezone. I use Scizor to revenge things like Swampert at 40%. Since the opponent will usually switch at that point, I can either discourage switching or gain the advantage on a switch. EV'd to always survive a Celebi Hidden Power Fire after Stealth Rock, with the rest in speed, conveniently just enough to outspeed most Skarmory. I wish I could up the speed to outspeed Vaporeon, but I just can't.  

### Heatran - "BBQ Time"
![Heatran]()  
Moves:  

- Explosion
- Earth Power
- Fire Blast
- Stealth Rock  

Item: Choice Scarf  
Ability: Flash Fire  
EVs: 6 Atk / 252 Spe / 252 SpA  
Nature: Naive (+Spe, -SpD)  
> And we finish at the start. After looking over the team, I needed a few things with only one slot available: A stealth rocker, a lead, and something that can switch into Rotom and electricity in general. Synergy wise, Heatran was the only Pokemon that really made sense. I started out with Heatran, who worked great, but it left me very vulnerable to Choice Specs Jolteon, who can easily come in on Vaporeon. I tested many other leads: Gliscor, Celebi, even Camerupt, but none of them really fit that well, even costing me some sleep. It was then that Phil suggested to me to just add a scarf to Heatran. After testing this, it worked out great. Yeah, Jolteon or Rotom can switch in on Vaporeon, but then I can just go to Heatran, always outspeed and kill it. This works great since Heatran does not get worn down by electric attacks, since Vaporeon can wish on the switch, Heatran can continually switch in and receive the Wish, healing itself. The scarf also lets me check Lucario again, so the opponent never knows whether to crunch or Close Combat, as I can go to either Gengar or Heatran, and another check to Latias, who can set up on Vaporeon, in case Scizor gets trapped early.  

## Team Rose Tyler
Team Rose Tyler aims to make use of Toxic Spikes, which are provided by a Roserade lead, in order to stall out the opposing team. In this team, Vashta uses a core of Substitute + Charge Beam Rotom, Curse Swampert and Substitute + Calm Mind Jirachi to stall for Toxic damage and then finish off the weakened team. Team Rose Tyler helped to inspire the increase in popularity of semi-stall as a playstyle, and its fantastic presentation along with its extensive descriptions make it a model RMT.
