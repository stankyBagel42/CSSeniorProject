# 4.1 The Teams
This section will provide information about the teams that are used in our training environment. Many of these teams were adapted from popular smogon teams of the Gen IV era, while some others were made by us. You might notice that the Pokemon are of varying levels. This is to balance teams with objectively stronger or weaker Pokemon.

Each Pokemon entry will include its nickname (if applicable), item, ability, EVs, nature, and moves.

## The OG
This team was adapted from the oldest entry I could find on the Gen IV smogon forum. I'll include notes from the original author.
