# 4.2 Challenging the Bot
To challenge the bot, you must first access the Python file at `~/src/challenge_bot.py`, where you must provide a path to a Player Checkpoint file under `model_path`. There, you must also enter your Pokemon Showdown username under `opponent_username`.

Once your Anaconda environment is running, you can make the battler challenge you by running the command from the root directory:
`python -m src.challenge_bot`.
