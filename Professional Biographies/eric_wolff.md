## About Me
I am Eric Wolff, a Computer Science student at the University of Cincinnati. I love almost every field of science and statistics that I have found and am always looking to learn more. I have been working with machine learning for the past 5-6 years, so most of my current work skills are in that area, but I am always willing to learn more about other things!
