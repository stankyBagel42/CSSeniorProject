## Project Sought

I'm still thinking about what I want my project to be about, but I have thought about the form that I want to pursue. I think I'd like to explore making a mobile app, something with AI, or maybe making a game. I haven't had a lot of experience doing any of these so I think trying to work outside of my comfort zone would be a good experience for a capstone project.
